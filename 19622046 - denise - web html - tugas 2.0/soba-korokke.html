        <h3> Korokke (コロッケ) is the Japanese name for a deep-fried yōshoku dish originally related to a French dish, <br>
        the croquette. Korokke is made by mixing cooked chopped meat, seafood, or vegetables with mashed potato or white <br>
        sauce, usually shaped like a flat patty, rolling it in wheat flour, eggs, and Japanese-style breadcrumbs, then <br>
        deep-frying this until brown on the outside. </h3>
        <br>
        <h3> Korokke soba (コロッケそば) itself is a soba served with korroke on top. </h3>
