            <h3> Oroshi soba (おろしそば) means “grated daikon buckwheat noodles.” It’s one of the popular soba noodle menus <br>
            that you can find at noodle shops in Japan and it’s served hot or cold. The signature of this dish is the grated <br>
            daikon on top of the noodles. </h3>
            <br>
            <h2> HOW TO MAKE? </h2>
            <br>
            <b> INGREDIENTS </b> <br>
            <br>
            6 oz dried soba noodles (buckwheat noodles), 7 oz daikon radish (2", 5 cm), 1 green onion/scallion (for topping) <br>
            ½ cup katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes) (for topping; skip for vegan/vegetarian), 3 tbsp tenkasu/agedama <br>
            (tempura scraps) (for optional topping), 1 tbsp shredded nori seaweed (kizami nori) (for topping) <br>
            <br>
            <b> Sauce </b> <br>
            <br>
            1 ½ cup water (for vegan/vegetarian make vegan dashi), 1 cup katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes) <br>
            (skip for vegan/vegetarian), 1 tbsp sugar, 1 tbsp mirin, 3 tbsp soy sauce, ¼ tsp kosher salt <br>
            (Diamond Crystal; use half for table salt) <br>
            <br>
            <b> INSTRUCTIONS </b> <br>
            <br>
            1. In a medium saucepan, add water and bring it to near boiling point. <br>
            2. Add the katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes) and let it simmer for 15 seconds, <br>
            and then turn off the heat. Set aside and let the katsuobushi steep for 15 minutes. <br>
            3. Meanwhile, peel daikon skin, grate it, and set aside. <br>
            4. Cut the green onion into fine rounds. <br>
            5. After 15 minutes of steeping, strain the katsuo dashi into a measuring cup. You <br>
            should have 1 ¼ cup. If you don’t have it enough, add water. <br>
            6. Add mirin, sugar, and soy sauce. Bring it to boil on medium heat and turn off the heat. <br>
            7. Mix well and taste it. If necessary, season with kosher salt. <br>
            8. Place the pot in iced water to cool the sauce down before transferring to the refrigerator <br>
            (if you are planning to serve later on). <br>
            9. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Do not use small pot when cooking noodles. <br>
            For cooking soba noodles, we do not salt the water. Also, remove the paper bands on <br>
            bundles of soba noodles first. To cook all the soba equally, it’s best to prepare and <br>
            have it ready to go. <br>
            10. Once the water is boiling, add the soba and quickly stir so the noodles don’t stick <br>
            to each other. Cook the soba noodles according to the package instructions. Keep the water <br> 
            boiling on medium to medium-high heat. <br>
            11. Drain the soba noodles (you can reserve the soba water “Sobayu” for drinking). <br>
            Rinse the soba noodles well under cold water to remove the starch. <br>
            12. Serve the noodles in individual dishes, and divide the sauce. <br>
            13. Now for the topping, gently squeeze the grated daikon and place on top of the noodles <br>
            (Don’t squeeze too hard and save some moisture so it’s more refreshing, but too much liquid <br>
            will dilute the sauce). Place katsuobushi, tenkasu, green onion, and shredded nori. <br>
            Serve immediately. <br>
            <br>
